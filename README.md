# Fancy-Buttons
A jQuery-dependant 3D interactive button fancifier

This is a simple plugin which can turn boring buttons into cool 3D interactive widgets!

There are two variants - one for traditional buttons (where the interaction only begins on click), and another for items that you want to be immediately interactive on hover.

Simply add the class 'fancy-button' to any button where you would like to see the effect and watch as it automagically converts your existing button into a <i>Fancy Button</i>.

Tested on Android, iOS, Safari, Firefox and Chrome.
